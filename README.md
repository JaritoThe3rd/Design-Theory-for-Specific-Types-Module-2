Narrative

What happened before
Anything we should already know about?

You woke up in a hospital that's being treated as an evacuation point and a safezone for both military and civilians. The city from a far distance is being bombarded heavily by the military to slowdown the outbreak and hordes flushing out of the cities.


What needs to happen now
What story needs to be told during this level? What dialogues should happen?

By the time the player wakes up he/she been told that he/she needs to help other people and find other survivors that could help stabilize the situation within the safezone.


What will happen in the future
Is there anything we shouldn't mention, or should be foreshadowing?

Probably there's a limited amount of days where the player can stay within the hospital or else it will get overunned by the hordes and kill everyone. It also foreshadowed that the player needs to escape from the safezone, but it is not clear whether they can hold it off and save other people or let everyone die it us up to the player.

Mechanics

What mechanics can we already use
What is the range of tools and mechanics at our disposal? What can't we use yet?

Using guns, melee weapons, and utilities will be available right off the bat. Then there will be the building mechanics which reinforces the safezone and nearby buildings would require manpower and resources. Which the player can't exactly do yet right off the bat.


What mechanics need to be introduced
What is the best way to introduce new mechanics? How can we progress the player's skill with existing mechanics?

Scenario based tutorial would be the best where there will be a pause sequence and images will pop out to show the player how to do certain mechanics. Maybe once the player walks outside the hospital there will be military personnel training most civilians on how to fight the horde since they're short in manpower, but abundant with supplies.

Pacing

What should be the pacing of this level
How can we modulate the intensity of the action within the level?

Modulating the level based on the days that has passed which the outbreak gets worst and even deadlier.

How does this level fit in the sequence of levels?
What do we need to know about the player experience so far? What comes next?


Player will experience actual fear from the environment since permadeath is a system for your main character and other survivors.
